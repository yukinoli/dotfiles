Introduction to Writer4LaTeX
The purpose of the Writer4LaTeX extension is to turn Writer into a frontend for LaTeX.
        By installing Writer4LaTeX you will thus be available to author well-structured LaTeX documents using (almost) the full power of
        %PRODUCTNAME Writer.
		The functionality of %PRODUCTNAME Writer with Writer4LaTeX can be compared to the application
		LyX.
		
Authoring LaTeX files with Writer4LaTeX
You can use Writer4LaTeX in two different ways
        
You can prepare your documents with Writer as you usually do,
        		keeping a few
        		guidelines in mind.
        		You can then invoke Writer4LaTeX to convert your document into LaTeX, process the LaTeX document and display the final result. You are free to create either  a LaTeX document that preserves as much of your formatting as possible â€“ or create a clean LaTeX document that will resemble a LaTeX document created by hand.
        		

You can use some special
        		Writer templates
        		provided with Writer4LaTeX to
        		create your documents. Using the styles supported by these templates, you can easily create standard LaTeX documents
        		using the opportunities of standard LaTeX document classes.
        		
For this initial version, templates for the standard LaTeX classes article
		        are provided. More templates will be added later (report, book, beamer...), and you can also add your own templates.
		        


Before you start
Before you can use Writer4LaTeX, you need to
        configure it.
        This requires that you have installed certain software on your system.
